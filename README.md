Questions to be answered:

What are the effects of different countries’ government healthcare expenditures on their respective mortality rates?
Based on data from 2010-2022, create a predictive model re: the  kinds of changes to health expenditures countries should make to lessen mortality rates via preemptive healthcare.

Tasks:
- Barrett - Visualizations/Slide Deck
- Ben - Back End (ETL)
- Cory - Data and Data Delivery
- Kelly - Big Data Coding using SQL Database
ALL - Collaboratively Create a Categorical Machine Learning Model to Streamline Health Expenditure Recommendations

Goals:
- Selecting (a) dataset(s) and formulating a problem 
- Outlining questions to be answered, tasks to be done etc.
- Writing a one pager project proposal.
Methodology:
- Data Extraction: pull data from WHO datasets and merge them (most likely on Countries listed in both). 
- Data Preprocessing: clean data sets by removing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Extract relevant features from data sets. Store data in SQL database and query data based on targeted features.
- Model Development: utilize most effective machine learning models (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests TBD) and the Scikit-learn machine learning library
- Model Evaluation and Statistical Analysis: display the model’s accuracy, precision, and recall
- Interpretation and Visualization: Will use Tableau to present a Dashboard
